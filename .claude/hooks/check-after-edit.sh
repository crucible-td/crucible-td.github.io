# PostToolUse hook (Write|Edit): after a source or test file changes, typecheck
# and run the fast tests. Exit 2 + stderr is the Claude Code convention for
# "block and feed this back to Claude" -- so a failure lands in the model's
# context automatically, without the user needing to paste it in.
#
# Fast tests only, deliberately. The full suite takes ~24 seconds, and all but
# half a second of that is two files: tests/diversity.test.ts runs a 240-build
# campaign sample at module load, and tests/campaign.test.ts plays twenty
# rounds on several seeds. Those are the measurements this project is built
# on, but they answer a question about balance, not about whether the edit
# just made compiles and behaves -- and a 24-second pause after every keystroke
# turns the hook into something to switch off. `npm test` still runs
# everything, and CI runs it on every push before it will deploy.
